Through this website, we may collect the email addresses and phone numbers of those who communicate with us via email, as well as other information volunteered by the site visitor.<\/p>\n<p>We will use your contact information only to provide the information requested, and to correspond with you via mail, phone, social media and\/or email if you are interested. If you provide other information, we may use it to improve the content of our web pages or for general marketing purposes, but we do not share it with other organizations or marketers for commercial purposes. If you supply us with your postal address online, you may receive periodic mailings from us with information on new products, services or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive mail, phone calls and\/or emails from us, please indicate your preferences on the website Contact Us page and submit, or you may contact us at the above address or telephone number.<\/p>\n<p>Table & Twine takes precautions to keep the user information disclosed to us secure. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and to ensure the appropriate use of information, all personal data is transmitted via a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and access to personal data is restricted via a username and password authentication process. Only authorized Table & Twine employees are permitted to access personally identifiable information, and the authorized individuals may do so only for specific work-related purposes. Table & Twine strives to protect your personal information; however, we urge you to take every precaution when you are on the internet. To better protect your information, be sure to change your passwords often and use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters.<\/p>\n<p>We also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, replying to an email or coordinating a facility tour) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers\/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Cookies<\/h3>\n<p>This website uses “cookies.” These are small text files with a unique identification number transferred from a website to a user’s hard drive, so the website administrator can track the user’s activities on the site. A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, or capture your email address. The information gained from the cookies are primarily used to analyze trends, administer the site, track the user's movement, and gather broad demographic and geographic information for aggregate use. No personally identifiable data collected is shared with third parties. Cookies associated with a particular website may only be accessed by that website.<\/p>\n<p>This website may also use cookies, web beacons, and other storage technologies to collect or receive specific types of information and use that information to provide targeted ads to advertise on third party websites (including Google, Bing and Facebook) to previous visitors to our site. It could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven’t completed a task on our site, for example using the contact form to make an inquiry. This could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google search results page, a site in the Google Display Network, or social media networks. The information may also be used for frequency capping purposes (such as ensuring we do not display the same advertisement to you repeatedly) and to help us regulate the advertisements you receive and measure their effectiveness.<\/p>\n<p>You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Preferences page. You may also use the Network Advertising Initiative’s (NAI) Opt-Out Tool at networkadvertising.org\/choices. This allows you to opt out from the use of information about your online activities for online behavioral advertising by NAI member companies.<\/p>\n<p>Table & Twine does not trade, sell or employ telemarketing services; however as an additional resource you may wish to register your phone number with the Federal Trade Commission’s National Do Not Call Registry which provides consumers the choice of whether to receive telemarketing calls at home.

Since 1978, the Humane Society of Charlotte has upheld its mission of creating new, loving families while building a world where there are no more homeless or unwanted animals. We’re excited to partner with this long-standing pillar of our community and support Charlotte's furry friends, both in your home & at the Humane Society of Charlotte.",
